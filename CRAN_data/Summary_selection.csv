The resulting sentence network is next plugged into the 'Pagerank' algorithm which identifies the most important sentences in your text and ranks them. In a similar way 'textrank' can also be used to extract keywords. A word network is constructed by looking if words are following one another. On top of that network the 'Pagerank' algorithm is applied to extract relevant words after which relevant words which are following one another are combined to get keywords.

Integration is achieved to identify a gene subnetwork from the whole gene network whose nodes/genes are labelled with informative data (such as the significant levels of differential expression or survival risks). To help make sense of identified gene networks, enrichment analysis is also supported using a wide variety of pre-compiled ontologies and phylostratific gene age information in major organisms including: human, mouse, rat, chicken, C.elegans, fruit fly, zebrafish and arabidopsis.

We extend and generalize the approach of Balke and Pearl (1994) <doi:10.1016/B978-1-55860-332-5.50011-0> and we provide a user friendly graphical interface for setting up such problems via directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which only allow for problems within this class to be depicted. The user can then define linear constraints to further refine their assumptions to meet their specific problem, and then specify a causal query using a text interface. The program converts this user defined DAG, query, and constraints, and returns tight bounds. The bounds can be converted to R functions to evaluate them for specific datasets, and to latex code for publication.

SRS,0,18,2,31/08/2020 12:00,"Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement. See Beule & Karlovsky (2020) <doi:10.7717/peerj.9593> for details.",1
